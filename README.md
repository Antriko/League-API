# League API

## Just testing for personal use

Updated for their MATCH-V5 API

Any data pre match-v5 has been purged, so not every game is taken into accont.

Wanted to find out what % and total amount of games has been with a friend of mine, as far back as the API would allow.

### Installation
Install packages `npm i`

Change the variable summonerName in main.js then use console to run `node main.js`, same concept with `node compareFiles.js`
